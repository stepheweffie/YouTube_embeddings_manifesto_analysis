You may not realize it, but you are currently funding some dangerous people
They are indoctrinating young minds throughout the West with their resentment-ridden ideology
They have made it their life's mission to undermine Western civilization itself,which they regard as corrupt, oppressive and “patriarchal
”If you're a taxpayer—or paying for your kid's liberal arts degree—you're underwritingthis gang of nihilists
You're supporting ideologues who claim that all truth is subjective; that all sex differencesare socially constructed; and that Western imperialism is the sole sourceof all Third World problems
They are the post-modernists, pushing “progressive” activism at a college near you
They produce the mobs that violently shut down campus speakers; the language policewho enshrine into law use of fabricated gender pronouns; and the deans whose livelihoodsdepend on madly rooting out discrimination where little or none exists
Their thinking took hold in Western universities in the ‘60s and ‘70s, when the true believersof the radical left became the professors of today
And now we rack up education-related debt—not so that our children learn to think critically,write clearly, or speak properly, but so they can model their mentors' destructive agenda
It's now possible to complete an English degree and never encounter Shakespeare—one of thosedead white males whose works underlie our “society of oppression
”To understand and oppose the post-modernists, the ideas by which they orient themselvesmust be clearly identified
First is their new unholy trinity of diversity, equity and inclusion
Diversity is defined not by opinion, but by race, ethnicity or sexual identity; equityis no longer the laudable goal of equality of opportunity, but the insistence on equalityof outcome; and inclusion is the use of identity-based quotas to attain this misconceived state of equity
All the classic rights of the West are to be considered secondary to these new values
Take, for example, freedom of speech—the very pillar of democracy
The post-modernists refuse to believe that people of good will can exchange ideasand reach consensus
Their world is instead a Hobbesian nightmare of identity groups warring for power
They don't see ideas that run contrary to their ideology as simply incorrect
They see them as integral to the oppressive system they wish to supplant, and considerit a moral obligation to stifle and constrain their expression
Second is rejection of the free market—of the very idea that free, voluntary tradingbenefits everyone
They won't acknowledge that capitalism has lifted up hundreds of millions of peopleso they can for the first time in history afford food, shelter, clothing, transportation—even entertainment and travel
Those classified as poor in the US (and, increasingly, everywhere else) are able to meet their basic needs
Meanwhile, in once-prosperous Venezuela—until recently the poster-child of the campus radicals—the middle class lines up for toilet paper
Third, and finally, are the politics of identity
Post-modernists don't believe in individuals
You're an exemplar of your race, sex, or sexual preference
You're also either a victim or an oppressor
No wrong can be done by anyone in the former group, and no good by the latter
Such ideas of victimization do nothing but justify the use of powerand engender intergroup conflict
All these concepts originated with Karl Marx, the 19th-century German philosopher
Marx viewed the world as a gigantic class struggle—the bourgeoisie against the proletariat;the grasping rich against the desperate poor
But wherever his ideas were put into practice—in the Soviet Union, China, Vietnam, and Cambodia,to name just a few—whole economies failed, and tens of millions were killed
We fought a decades-long cold war to stop the spread of those murderous notions
But they're back, in the new guise of identity politics
The corrupt ideas of the post-modern neo-Marxists should be consigned to the dustbin of history
Instead, we underwrite their continuance in the very institutions where the central ideasof the West should be transmitted across the generations
Unless we stop, post-modernism will do to America and the entire Western worldwhat it's already done to its universities
